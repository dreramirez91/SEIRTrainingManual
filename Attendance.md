# Attendance

SEIRs will drop an attendance token on SIS everyday class is in session at precisely the following times:

- 9:00am
- 1:45pm
- 5:00pm 

Ensure that these times align with the timezone of the cohort you are overseeing.

Students that join the meeting after the token expires and up to 15 minutes late should be marked as tardy. Any students joining after that time should be marked absent. 

## Announcing

When the token is dropped, at least one SEIR should verbally announce its deployment in the Zoom meeting and remind all students to be visible on camera. Students not visible on camera by 5 minutes after the token is dropped should be marked as *tardy*.

Additionally, when the token is dropped, at least one SEIR should notify students through the Live Channel in Slack, using @here to ensure all members of that channel receive the notification. Example: "@here Attendance token is live! You have until 9:05 am PST! *professional emoji of your choice*"

## Auditing

While students are submitting their token, one or more SEIRs need to audit whether the submitting students are present. One way to do this is to click on the ✋ Take button in SIS, allowing you to view the live feed of all students who have submitted their attendance token. The SEIR can then open the participants tab of the Zoom meeting and, going down the live feed one by one, type the students' names into the participants search bar to ensure they are present. The SEIR should then verify that all students are visible on camera.

## Reporting

After attendance has been taken for that portion of the day, one SEIR must report in the Attendance Slack Channel in the following format:

Date(MM/DD) One of (Morning/Afternoon/Evening):

Tardy:
*list of tardy students*

Absent:
*list of absent students*

Excused:
*list of excused students*

Note, if a student should be marked excused, that will have been reported by their Cohort Lead (CL) along with a note that should be included on the token page when you submit their excusal.

## Revisions

If a student requests that you "give them their token back" because of some excuse or another, you must first get approval from their CL. **No revisions to student attendance should be made with the CL's approval outside of a SEIR pressing the wrong button after the attendance token has expired (e.g. pressing "Excused" when the student should have been marked "Tardy.")**
